This project was made in the context of the 2021 Physics Hackathon held by McGill University. You can see our submition

# **Features**
Allows user to visualize a real-time simulation of a multibody pendulum while modifying the factors influencing its behaviors.
Lets instructor demo the behavior of certain systems while showcasing the chaotic nature of multibody pendulums via the path-plot as well as the phase-space plot.

---
**Usage**
Visit this website and start playing with the pendulums. As this project will progress, more simulations should become available for general use.

**Examples of visualization**
Double pendulum undamped simulation which ran for a long time while displaying the space-phase plot of theta-1 vs.theta-2 Double pendulum simulation with undamped motion - it ran for a long time while displaying the space-phase plot of theta-1 versus theta-2
